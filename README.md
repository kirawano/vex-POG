The best **bot** that you have ever seen. The best of the best.

# Exodia, the Forbidden One



According to all known la*w*s
of av*i*ation,
there is no way a bee
should be able to f*l*y.
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little bo*d*y off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway
because bees don't care
what *hu*mans thi*n*k is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake i*t* up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Ooming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
- Barry?
- Adam?
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
